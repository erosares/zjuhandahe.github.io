1.	OVERVIEW

The ESP system currently executes 2 Basel III cycles (Ready1, Ready2) for any given day spanning Category Loads, Enrichment, Proration and Extracts processes. The Enrichment process gets repeated in entirety every time when the Ready2 and subsequent B3 cycles are run for a given day. Running the Full Enrichment process one time in full for a given day (as part of Ready1 cycle) is sufficient for Basel III purposes. Whereas, for the Ready2 and subsequent cycles we only need to run a subset of Enrichment functions necessary to override the Basel III flags. 
To rationalize the Enrichment process for Ready2 and subsequent cycles (aka Basel III Override Cycle) there by improving Basel III End to End Cycle Timings, the project team and the business is considering the below changes in the Agency & Enhanced Custody Enrichment process in ESP platform.
Currently, the Enrichment cycle takes about 45 Minutes on a typical record count of 1.5 Million (excluding Derived Code = 2 records). Hence, rationalizing the Enrichment cycle could result in considerable time savings there by reducing the overall Basel III cycle. 

Manual Ratings:
Cumulatively we have about 250+ securities using the Manual Ratings data entered by the users there by impacting about 6,000 position records. This includes all cycles (Ready1, Ready2 and subsequent cycles).

On 31Mar2016, Users will add new manual ratings for 15 security records, impacting 113 security position records.

B3 Overrides:
Cumulatively we override about 200+ cumulative securities based on the Override data uploaded by the users over a period of time there by impacting about 4000+ positions records. This includes all cycles (Ready1, Ready2 and subsequent cycles).

On 31Mar2016, Users added new overrides for 9 source/security records, impacting 408 security position records.

31Mar2016 Analysis Results:
Total security position records for 31Mar2016 = 1,368,988 (1.36 Million)
Security position records needing manual rating refresh = 113
Security position records requiring overrides = 408
Effective, Total security position records requiring to undergo Ready 2 cycle = 521


Basel III Process Cycle	No. Security Position Records Enriched	Comments
Ready 1	1,368,988	Approx. 1.36 Million
Current Ready 2 & Onwards	1,368,988	Approx. 1.36 Million
Proposed Ready 2 & Onwards	521	Only 521



1.	Create an Override Enrichment Cycle
2.	Identify New Security Overrides uploaded by user and apply overrides
3.	Manual Ratings:
a.	Refresh Manual Ratings category
b.	Identify securities requiring an update to Manual Ratings and capture the change for audit purposes
c.	For identified securities, Recalculate Rating Grades based on updated manual ratings
d.	For identified securities, Recalculate Rating Eligibility (Coll Eligibility Flag & Loan Sec Eligibility Flag) 
e.	In case of change in flag values, Re-Calculate Investment Grade, Pre Eligibility Basel III flags
4.	B3 Overrides or Manual Ratings refreshed securities:
a.	Only for identified securities, Apply New Investment Grade and the New Overrides as required and Recalculate B3 Enhanced Collateral Eligibility & B3 Security Eligibility Flags
b.	Override Main Index Flag as required
c.	Override FRB STD Classification as required 
5.	In case of change in B3 Security Eligibility or Main Index Flags change – Recalculate FRB STD Classification
6.	Override B3 Liquidity Flag
7.	In case of change in Rating Grades, Recalculate Liquidity for security positions classified under B3 Asset Class = ‘Securitizations’ 
 
Current Basel III Ready 2 Cycle Flow:
 
 
Proposed Basel III Ready 2 Cycle Flow:

 



Basel III Fields in Enriched Data Mart:
Current Flow - Number of Basel III Fields Calculated = 87 (All Securities)
  		EC : 45 Fields
AG : 42 Fields
Proposed Flow - Number of Basel III Fields Calculated = 42 (Select Securities)
		  EC : 21 Fields

3.	ASSUMPTIONS

1.	We will not be loading the STARSBII. MANUAL_COLL_ELIGIBILITY table data into ESP for the Basel III Ready2 and subsequent cycles. However, this data will be loaded into ESP as part of Basel III Ready1 cycle.
2.	We will be loading the STARS.MANUAL_RATINGS table data into ESP for the Basel III Ready2 and subsequent cycles
3.	The Ceres Lowest Rating and corresponding Rating Grades are loaded and being used in ESP enrichment
4.	The Coll Eligibility Flag dependency, fall back logic removal will be taken up as separate stories as part of other iterations
5.	The DML Prices related improvements will be taken up as separate stories as part of other iterations

4.	BUSINESS REQUIREMENTS

4.1	Create a New Override Enrichment Cycle in ESP

4.1.1	Create a new process routine in ESP to run only an essential subset of Enrichment Functions as part of Enrichment Process referred as Override Enrichment Cycle throughout this document.
4.1.2	The proposed process routine in ESP may require new store procedures and/or changes to the existing Enrichment cycle and/or new indexing at table levels.
4.1.3	The proposed process routine may require Meta model changes also may need new services in ESP
4.1.4	Users should be able to run the proposed process routine to trigger the Override Enrichment Cycle, hence, impacting only select security positions in the Enriched Data Mart.

4.2	Override File – User Trigger Full Enrichment or Partial 
4.2.1	Add a new field in Override File and ESP Category 
  OVERRIDE_TYPE
4.2.2	Users should be able to update this field along with the other override flags as per the requirement. 
Intended values: ‘PARTIAL’,’COMPLETE’
PARTIAL- Partial Enrichment 
COMPLETE- Complete Enrichment
Ex: User should use ‘PARTIAL’ to trigger Override Enrichment Cycle (Run on limited records). Alternatively, User can use ‘COMPLETE’ to trigger the Full Enrichment Cycle based on their need.[In Case, where we have both values  'PARTIAL' and 'COMPLETE', 'COMPLETE' Enrichment process should be run.]
Note: Once the override cycle completes this field will get updated as ‘COMPLETE’ in the override table which holds good for the next day’s run.
4.2.3	ESP system should be able to trigger the Full Enrichment or Partial Enrichment cycles based on the user input in B3 Override File/Category. 

4.3	Identify New Securities Overridden by user
4.3.1	Based on the override file uploaded by users, the system should be able identify the new securities overridden as part of Ready2 or subsequent cycles. 
4.3.2	If no new securities are overridden the enrichment results will be same as before. 

Number of New override records added on 31Mar2016 = 9 Records
It impacted 408 security positions in Enriched DataMart for 31Mar2016
Attached is the list of Basel III new overrides done for 31Mar2016.
 

4.4	Perform Overrides
4.4.1	Based on the override file uploaded by users, the system should be able identify the new securities overridden as part of the Ready2 or subsequent cycles. 

4.4.2	For the identified securities, apply the overridden values to the below fields with values from override file uploaded by the users
1.	B3 Override Reason
2.	Ovrd B3 Enhanced Coll Eligibility Flag
3.	Ovrd B3 Security Eligibility Flag
4.	Ovrd Main Index Flag
5.	Ovrd B3 FRB Std Classification
6.	Ovrd B3 Liquidity Flag

4.5	Refresh Manual Ratings Category 
4.5.1	System should be able refresh the Manual Ratings category as part of the proposed Override Enrichment cycle. 
4.5.2	As soon as Override Enrichment Cycle is triggered, system should refresh the Manual Ratings category with data available at that point in time.

4.6	Identify New Securities requiring Manual Ratings Refresh 
4.6.1	System should be able identify the new securities that require a Manual Ratings refresh.

Logic to identify the securities requiring Manual ratings refresh:

1)	Securities that satisfy below conditions should be considered for manual ratings refresh,
CERES_LOWEST_RATING IS NULL ---No MDD ratings
B3_DER_RATING_GRAD_SRC <> 'SPUS' --- Not a SFIT security 
MANUAL_RATING_FLG <> ‘Y’ --- No Manual ratings
 Position type code (1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 10)---Non cash positions

Sample Query to identify the records from enriched mart,

AG:
SELECT DISTINCT B3_ASSET_CLASS, B3_ASSET_SUB_CLASS, SEC_SEC_ID, SEC_CUSIP_ID, SEC_SEDOL_ID, SEC_ISIN_ID, MANUAL_RATING_FLG, B3_DER_RATING_GRAD_SRC, POS_TYPE_CD_0 
FROM ORI.DM_AG_POSN_B3_ENRICHED WHERE AS_OF = '31-MAR-2016'  --- '10-MAY-2016' 
AND CERES_LOWEST_RATING IS NULL 
AND POS_TYPE_CD_0 NOT IN (3, 5, 9) 
AND B3_DER_RATING_GRAD_SRC <> 'SPUS' 
AND MANUAL_RATING_FLG <> 'Y'
ORDER BY SEC_SEC_ID, B3_ASSET_CLASS, B3_ASSET_SUB_CLASS, SEC_CUSIP_ID,
SEC_SEDOL_ID, SEC_ISIN_ID, MANUAL_RATING_FLG, B3_DER_RATING_GRAD_SRC, POS_TYPE_CD_0 ; --- 15 SECURITIES 

EC:
SELECT DISTINCT SEC_SEC_ID, SEC_CUSIP_ID, SEC_SEDOL_ID, SEC_ISIN_ID 
FROM ORI.DM_EC_POSN_B3_ENRICHED WHERE AS_OF = '10-MAY-2016' 
AND CERES_LOWEST_RATING IS NULL
 AND EC_POSITION_TYPE_CD IN (1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 10)
AND B3_DER_RATING_GRAD_SRC <> 'SPUS' 
AND MANUAL_RATING_FLG <> 'Y'; 

2)	Records identified from above step should be verified in the Manual ratings table for any addition in the ratings

4.6.2	The Manual Ratings should be applied to respective rating fields of the security

1.	SEC_SP_RATING_TXT
2.	SEC_MOODY_RATING_TXT
3.	SEC_FITCH_RATING_TXT

Note: The existing logic, give precedence to manual ratings over OIR ratings for securities with Null SP and Null Moody and Null Fitch Ratings, still holds good. There is no change to this logic.

4.6.3	The Manual Ratings Flag should be set to Y for these security positions indicating the use of manual ratings, for audit purposes.


4.7	Re-Calculate Rating Grades for Select Securities
4.7.1	Select the securities updated with manual rating, if the Ceres Rating Grade is not available, then Recalculate Lowest Rating Text and corresponding Rating Grades based on updated manual ratings. 
Please note there is no change to the existing logic for Rating Grade derivation. 

4.7.2	The Re-Calculation is necessary since any change in Rating Grade affects:
1.	Basel III Eligibility
2.	Liquidity (Only for B3 Asset Class = Securitizations)

Number of New Manual Ratings records that will be added (31Mar2016) = 15 Records

It will impact 113 security positions in Enriched DataMart for 31Mar2016

Attached is the list of Manual Ratings that will be added for 31Mar2016

 

4.8	Re-Calculate Basel III Flags in case of a change in Rating Grades for Select Securities
4.8.1	Only for identified securities, Recalculate the below flags since a change in Rating Grade affects the below Basel III fields
1.	Coll Eligibility Flag (Rating eligibility proxy for Non-Sovereign Flow)
2.	Loan Sec Eligibility Flag (Rating eligibility proxy for Non-Sovereign Flow)
3.	B3 Investment Grade Flag
4.	Pre B3 Enhanced Coll Eligibility Flag
5.	Pre B3 Security Eligibility Flag
6.	Pre B3 FRB Std Classification
7.	Pre B3 Liquidity Flag
4.8.2	Coll Eligibility Flag: Recalculate this field since the underlying Rating Grade may have changed and it’s used as a proxy for Rating Eligibility in Non-Sovereign flow for collaterals.
4.8.3	Loan Sec Eligibility Flag: Recalculate this field since the underlying Rating Grade may have changed and its used as a proxy for Rating Eligibility in Non-Sovereign flow for loans
4.8.4	B3 Investment Grade Flag: Recalculate this field since the underlying Rating Grade may have changed and its used as an input to other Basel III Eligibility Flags
4.8.5	Pre B3 Enhanced Coll Eligibility Flag: Recalculate this field since the underlying Investment Grade Flag may have changed
4.8.6	Pre B3 Security Eligibility Flag: Recalculate this field since the underlying Enhanced Coll Eligibility or Investment Grade Flag may have changed 
4.8.7	Pre B3 FRB STD Classification: Recalculate this field since the underlying Security Eligibility Flag may have changed 
4.8.8	Pre B3 Liquid Flag: Recalculate this field since the underlying Rating Grade may have changed

4.9	Derive the Final Basel III Flags
4.9.1	Based on the securities impacted by Manual Ratings refresh or by Override; derive the final Basel III Flags ending the Override Enrichment Cycle

1.	B3 Enhanced Coll Eligibility Flag
2.	B3 Security Eligibility Flag
3.	B3 FRB Std Classification
4.	B3 Liquidity Flag

4.10	Additional Fields to identify New Enrichment Process
4.10.1	Add a new field in Enrichment mart
1)	A new field ‘OVERRIDE_CYCLE_FLG’ should be added in enriched mart
